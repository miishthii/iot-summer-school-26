# 🌊 River Water Level Alert (Flood Detection)

## 📌 Problem Statement

Flooding near the Tawi and Chenab rivers poses significant risks to nearby communities. This project designs a low-cost IoT-based flood early warning system that continuously monitors river water levels using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. As water levels rise (distance decreases), the system classifies the situation into Normal, Warning, or Critical levels and provides visual, audible, and cloud-based alerts.

# 💡 Solution Approach

An **ESP32** continuously measures the distance between an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** and the water surface. Since the sensor is mounted above the water, a **decrease in measured distance indicates a rise in water level**.

To reduce fluctuations caused by ultrasonic sensor noise, the system calculates a **rolling average** of recent distance measurements before transmitting the data to the cloud.

Three flood alert levels are implemented:

- 🟢 **NORMAL** – Safe water level
- 🟡 **WARNING** – Water level rising
- 🔴 **CRITICAL** – Immediate flood risk

Each level activates a different LED and buzzer pattern. The measured water level and alert status are uploaded to **ThingSpeak** over Wi-Fi for remote monitoring and live visualization.

# 🌊 Flood Alert Levels

| Water Clearance | Alert Level |
|----------------|-------------|
| **>30 cm** | 🟢 NORMAL |
| **15–30 cm** | 🟡 WARNING |
| **<15 cm** | 🔴 CRITICAL |

Since the ultrasonic sensor is mounted above the river:

- Higher distance → Lower water level
- Lower distance → Higher water level

# ⚠ Simulation Notes

This project was developed using **Wokwi**.

- The HC-SR04 sensor simulates river water level measurements.
- LEDs are used to represent different flood alert stages.
- ThingSpeak is used as the cloud dashboard to visualize sensor readings in real time.
- The buzzer patterns simulate emergency warning levels for nearby residents.
