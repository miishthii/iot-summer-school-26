# 🌿 Smart Greenhouse Controller

## 📌 Problem Statement

Floriculture farmers in Kashmir growing tulips and roses require an automated greenhouse system to maintain optimal environmental conditions for healthy plant growth. This project designs an IoT-based Smart Greenhouse Controller that continuously monitors temperature, humidity, and light intensity while automatically controlling the heater, ventilation fan, and grow light. The system also publishes sensor data to an MQTT broker for remote monitoring.

# 💡 Solution Approach

An **ESP32** serves as the central controller of the greenhouse. A **DHT11 sensor** measures temperature and humidity, while an **LDR** continuously monitors ambient light intensity. To reduce noise from the light sensor, a **running average of the last 10 LDR readings** is calculated before making any control decisions.

The greenhouse uses a simple **bang-bang control algorithm with hysteresis** to maintain stable environmental conditions.

- If the temperature falls below the desired range, the heater is activated.
- If the temperature rises above the desired range, the ventilation fan is activated.
- If light intensity is insufficient, the grow light is switched on.

Three LEDs simulate the relay-controlled heater, fan, and grow light.

A **16×2 I2C LCD** cycles through sensor readings and actuator status every three seconds. All environmental parameters are also published to a public MQTT broker, allowing remote monitoring through any MQTT client.

# ⚙ Control Logic

The greenhouse controller uses **bang-bang control with hysteresis**.

### Temperature

- Temperature < 17°C → Heater ON
- Temperature > 23°C → Fan ON
- Temperature within range → Maintain current state

### Humidity

- Humidity > 75% → Fan ON

### Light

- Low light (LDR < Threshold) → Grow Light ON
- Bright conditions → Grow Light OFF

# 📺 LCD Display

The LCD automatically cycles every **3 seconds**.

# ☁ MQTT Cloud Monitoring

The ESP32 publishes greenhouse parameters to the **HiveMQ public broker**.

### Published Topics

| Topic | Data |
|--------|------|
| greenhouse/temp | Temperature |
| greenhouse/humidity | Humidity |
| greenhouse/light | Average LDR Value |
| greenhouse/heater | Heater Status |
| greenhouse/fan | Fan Status |
| greenhouse/lightStatus | Grow Light Status |

These topics can be monitored using MQTT Explorer or any MQTT dashboard.
